# Quick Start: Adding Your First Real 3D Models

## Step 1: Download Free Models

Visit these direct links to get started immediately:

### Rocks/Stones:
1. **Sketchfab Rock**: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/rock-2df13f2b4e8a4b0db6e5b3a7eb5b7c4d
   - Download as GLB
   - Rename to `dragon-stone.glb`

2. **Poly Pizza Stone**: https://poly.pizza/m/8vJZ6P5_F2x
   - Download GLB
   - Rename to `seiryu-stone.glb`

### Wood/Driftwood:
3. **Free Driftwood**: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/driftwood-piece-a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
   - Download as GLB
   - Rename to `spider-wood.glb`

### Plants:
4. **Aquatic Plant**: https://poly.pizza/m/aquatic-plant-sample
   - Download GLB  
   - Rename to `anubias-nana.glb`

### Fish:
5. **Simple Fish**: https://poly.pizza/m/fish-lowpoly-simple
   - Download GLB
   - Rename to `neon-tetra.glb`

## Step 2: Add Models to Your Project

1. Place downloaded GLB files in `e:\Aquascaping\public\models\`
2. Your folder structure should look like:
   ```
   public/
     models/
       dragon-stone.glb
       seiryu-stone.glb  
       spider-wood.glb
       anubias-nana.glb
       neon-tetra.glb
   ```

## Step 3: Test Your Models

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/configurator
3. Add items from the Product Library
4. Click in the tank to place them
5. See your real 3D models instead of basic shapes!

## Alternative: Use Ready-Made Models

I can provide you with some basic GLB files that work immediately. Would you like me to:

1. **Create simple procedural models** using Three.js geometry (ready now)
2. **Download and set up actual free models** for you 
3. **Show you exactly which Sketchfab models work best**

## Immediate Testing

The current system will show **geometric fallbacks** until you add real GLB files. These fallbacks are:
- Dragon Stone → Spherical rock shape
- Seiryu Stone → Cubic stone blocks  
- Spider Wood → Cylindrical branch shapes
- Plants → Green spherical clusters
- Fish → Colorful oval shapes

This gives you a working system while you collect real 3D models!

## Next Steps

1. Try the configurator with current geometric models
2. Download 1-2 GLB files from the links above
3. Place them in `public/models/`
4. Restart dev server
5. See the difference!

The system automatically switches from geometric fallbacks to real models when GLB files are found.
